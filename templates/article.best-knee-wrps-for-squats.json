Most commonly, they’re used for heavy squats. By encircling and binding the knee, wraps aim to provide enhanced structure and support to the joint.</p><p>When you lower yourself into a squat, the elastic material stretches out, storing energy. As you rise back up, the material swiftly snaps back, releasing the stored energy. It can have a variety of effects depending on one’s anatomy, but the potential benefits include maintaining joint integrity and stability throughout the exercise, reducing stress on the ligaments and tendons, and increasing power output for heavy lifts.</p><p>The majority of commercially available knee wraps for squatting follow a standardized build and size:</p><ol><li>A single-piece build (one long stripe)</li><li>A full length of roughly 2 meters/78 inches/6.5 feet depending on the manufacturer</li><li>3 inches wide throughout</li><li>Made from elastic materials, commonly neoprene</li><li>Mixed with cotton or another soft fabric to ease skin contact</li></ol>",

The first people who come to mind are, of course, powerlifters. For those unaware, the squat is one of the three main powerlifting exercises, alongside the bench press and deadlift. Aside from powerlifting enthusiasts, other people you’ll see squatting heavily are bodybuilders and strongman competitors, both of whom use heavy squats to keep up their mass and, in the latter's case, raw strength.</p><p>The only actual sports where knee wraps see applicable use are competitive weightlifting and powerlifting. There’s some controversy surrounding them regarding their benefit of improving performance and, thus, lifting more weight. Nevertheless, they’re allowed assuming they follow a standardized build (material, shape, length, etc.) set by the relevant rulebook.</p><p>For example, the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) allows the use of knee wraps. The summary of the ruling in the official <a href=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024.pdf\">2024 rulebook</a>, page 19, is as follows:</p><ol><li>Knee wraps must be made of a single piece of commercially woven elastic</li><li>They can be covered with polyester, cotton, or a combination of both</li><li>Knee wraps must not exceed 2m in length and 8cm in width.</li><li>A knee wrap may not extend beyond 15cm above and 15cm below the center of the knee</li><li>The total covering width may not exceed 30 cm.</li><li>A combination of knee wraps and knee sleeves is strictly forbidden.</li><li>Wraps must not come in contact with the socks or lifting suit.</li><li>Wraps can’t be used elsewhere on the body</li><li>Synthetic rubber is only acceptable in knee sleeves, not wraps</li><li>Most importantly, only <a href=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/approved-list/Approved__List_2023-2026_V2_01-11-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/approved-list/Approved__List_2023-2026_V2_01-11-2023.pdf\">officially approved</a> commercially manufactured gear can be used, with the only exception being medical bandages</li></ol><p>Meanwhile, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) — the governing body of the Summer Olympic Games weightlifting circuit — is even more relaxed on the topic. The <a href=\"https://iwf.sport/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2023/07/IWF-TCRR-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://iwf.sport/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2023/07/IWF-TCRR-2023.pdf\">official IFW rulebook</a> section 4.5.1.2 only says the following:</p><p>One-piece elastic bandages, neoprene / rubberised kneecaps, or patella protectors which allow free movement, may be worn on the knees. Kneecap bandages / protectors may not be reinforced by way of buckles, straps, whalebone, plastic or wire.</p><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"If you want to enter a competition for weightlifting or powerlifting, make sure to check the official rulebook for a list of approved gear. It’s not just knee wraps that have certain restrictions, so it’s important to learn in advance what you can and can’t wear to avoid surprises\"</em></p><h2>4 Benefits of Using Knee Wraps for Squats</h2><p>We briefly mentioned the potential benefits of weightlifting knee wraps in the previous section.

Power Boost</h3><p>Knee wraps store and release energy by stretching and contracting during the downward (eccentric) and upward (concentric) phases of the squat. The effect is similar to that of a slingshot, i.e. the more you pull back, the harder it will release. The wraps can <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\">boost your lift</a> both in terms of execution speed and power output, which is the main reason powerlifters use knee wraps for squatting.</p><h3>2. Joint Compression</h3><p>By wrapping snugly around the knee, wraps provide compression to the joint. The tightness of compression clothing has <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254621000922#fig0006\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254621000922#fig0006\">numerous positive effects</a>, most notably squeezing the blood vessels and improving blood flow.

Additionally, the wraps keep the joint warm, preventing a state of readiness and facilitating recovery.</p><h3>3. Enhanced Proprioception</h3><p>Despite what social media would lead you to believe, mirrors at the gym serve a bigger function than just helping you take pictures. They’re meant to give you visual feedback during an exercise, so you can judge for yourself whether everything looks good or not. However, not everything can be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>By compressing the joint, knee wraps also provide active feedback on the joint’s position and activity during a squat. This increases our <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080450469019070\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080450469019070\">proprioception</a>, i.e. the sense of our position and individual body parts. The heightened awareness assists with mind-muscle connection and reminds us of proper exercise techniques, which is helpful before the initial descent (eccentric phase) and ascend (concentric phase).</p><h3>4. Connective Tissue Support</h3><p>Every joint is essentially a bridge between two bigger anatomical structures. Without diving too much into complicated anatomy, you should know that connective tissue in your knees includes the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21604-ligament\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21604-ligament\">ligaments </a>and <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21738-tendon\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21738-tendon\">tendons</a>.</p><p>Ligaments are stretchable enough to allow for joint mobility but are also meant to keep the joint in one piece. The tightness of knee wraps can assist in this case, limiting excessive movement within the joint and retaining structural integrity. Additionally, the compression exerted by knee wraps can positively influence tendons, mimicking their role in storing and releasing elastic energy, thus providing them with assistance.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h2>3 Disadvantages of Knee Wraps for Squats</h2><p>Unfortunately for knee wraps, it’s not all upsides. In terms of common knee protection for squats, there are also notable downsides, which we will discuss below.</p><h3>1. Joint Weakness</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\">study we referenced earlier</a> that talked about knee wraps giving you a lifting boost also found a flaw that you should be aware of. The presence of knee squats slightly alters the dynamic of the exercise, affecting the targeted muscles and potentially compromising joint integrity. Based on this, the study recommends against wearing knee wraps during extended sets and reps with manageable weight. It also strongly suggests people with knee joint issues, such as injuries or medical conditions, avoid using knee wraps.</p><h3>2. Limited Use</h3><p>Knee wraps are essentially good for one thing only — boosting your lift. Thus, unless you’re purposely targeting your 1RM, you aren’t going to get much use out of them. They’re also fairly impractical considering you should wrap and unwrap them between each attempt to avoid damaging your knee.</p><p>Powerlifters will love them, but we also acknowledge that most people do not train for that purpose. If you want to add simple structural support, compression, and warmth to the joint without the potential downsides, go for knee sleeves instead.</p><h3>3. Overreliance</h3><p>At the end of the day, no amount of exercise assistance can improve your performance more than proper technique and training discipline. Using knee support for squats even when it’s unnecessary can be detrimental to the exercise and cause mental overreliance. Therefore, save your knee wraps for 1RM attempts and train without them.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Knee Wraps for Squats?</h2><p>Knee sleeves are fairly similar between brands, which can cause a bit of confusion on which to buy. Here are some factors you should be aware of that may sway your purchase decision.</p><h3>1. Length</h3><p>The standard length for knee wraps is around 2m or roughly 78”, a dimension mostly influenced by competitive rules. However, it’s not set in stone, and you’ll find both shorter and longer options. Most people will find the standardized size sufficient, but you may want to experiment based on your size and knee circumference.</p>",

This is not only practical when selecting for competitive use, but generally, a higher width could result in even more restricted mobility.</p><h3>3. Material</h3><p>No one wants to spend money on something that doesn’t work. Opting for higher-quality knee wraps will make sure they don’t give in during exercise, improving your safety. However, material quality will also impact the price of your wraps.</p><p>Keep in mind these wraps are designed for elite powerlifters who lift as much as 2-4 times their weight. If you’re below this threshold, cheaper wraps will be sufficient for now.</p><h3>4. Durability</h3><p>Durability is intricately tied to the quality of the material. However, frequency of use also impacts knee wrap longevity, and the higher the weight you lift, the more important durability becomes. If you want guaranteed quality, stick with trusted brands.</p><h3>5. Brand Reputation</h3><p>Brands like Rogue, Iron Bull Strength, and Warm Body Cold Mind have built their reputation based on decades of experience. Their products are designed by industry experts, ensuring quality and reliability fit for pros.</p><p>They typically carry a higher price tag, but the branding provides peace of mind for your purchase. If you’re looking to balance out your budget, we also listed up-in-comer brands we found to give good value for money.</p><h3>6. Competitive Compliance</h3><p>Different competitions can have differing rules on knee bands for squats. We touched upon standardized sizing throughout the article, but some rulesets also have strict definitions of approved vs. not approved knee wrap.</p><p>If you have competitive aspirations, you should check the official rulebook of the competition you want to enter and whether they have an official list of approved gear. Keep in mind that trusted brands are more likely to be allowed.</p>",

If needed, sit down to ensure your knee is not bent during the wrapping process.</li><li>Place the tab of the knee wrap slightly below the knee joint, at the base of your calf. Hold it securely with one hand.</li><li>With your free hand, begin unwrapping the material around your knee to create the first loop. Ensure it’s snug but not overtighten.</li><li>For each subsequent loop, wrap slightly upward. Overlap each wrap, covering at least half of the previous one, which prevents the wrap from unraveling.</li><li>Repeat the wrapping process until you've used the entire length of the material. To adjust tightness, stretch out the material.</li><li>Once you've reached the end of the material, use the provided fastening mechanism (such as Velcro or clips) to securely fasten the knee wrap in place. If there’s no fastening mechanism, simply tuck the loose end below the top wrap.</li></ol><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"Mind your leg hair. If you have excessive amounts of it, trim it down if you must. It can get stuck in the material as it stretches in and out. This can result in a painful tear mid-lift as the material snaps around, which can be discomforting or even distracting.\"</em></p><h2>Knee Wraps vs. Knee Sleeves vs. Knee Brace</h2><p>We understand that within our international audience, there may be some words with overlapping meanings. Therefore, we want to make a clear distinction between knee wraps, knee sleeves, and knee braces.</p><p>So, what’s the best knee support for squatting? Knee wraps shouldn’t need any more introduction as we’ve covered them in detail throughout the article.</p><p>So, let’s get knee braces out of the way. On the surface, they may seem similar to knee sleeves. However, they serve a different function. Knee braces <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21034-knee-brace\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21034-knee-brace\">are used for medical purposes</a> to keep the joint in place and prevent unwanted movement during recovery and/or physical therapy.</p><p>They’re prescribed to people dealing with existing knee injuries, ligament instability, osteoarthritis, post-surgery weakness, and similar issues. If you try to use them for exercise, you’ll find them overly restrictive, which is their point after all.</p>",

However, despite numerous positives, wearing knee sleeves <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/hms_etds/16/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/hms_etds/16/\">can’t increase squatting power</a>. Essentially, it is a jack of all trades but a master of none when it comes to knee support for squats.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Are Knee Wraps Good for Squatting?</h3><p>It depends on what your exercise goal is. Using knee straps for squats can increase kinematic output, helping you lift more. However, this effect is only present when lifting near maximum weight (at least 80%). It can also put added stress on the joint, which is why experts don’t recommend using it unless you’re attempting a single-repetition maximum (1RM) lift.</p><h3>Is Squatting with Knee Wraps Considered Cheating?</h3><p>Well, is wearing weightlifting shoes considered cheating? After all, we aren’t born with shoes, and proper footwear <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2016.1175652?journalCode=rjsp20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2016.1175652?journalCode=rjsp20\">can improve our exercise performance</a>. Personally, it’s down to your perspective: wear them or don’t, but be respectful of people’s choices.</p><p>Competitively speaking, it depends on which governing body and thus which rulebook is applied. The IPF, USPA, IWF, and USAW competitions allow them as long as they follow a standardized build. However, the only way to be sure is to check the rules before you enter.</p><h3>Do Knee Wraps Make You Stronger?</h3><p>Not in a literal sense, but there have been studies that showed knee wraps can <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/10000/wearing_knee_wraps_affects_mechanical_output_and.31.aspx\">increase exercise execution speed and peak power</a>. This could result in lifting more weight if that’s what you mean by “stronger”.</p>",
