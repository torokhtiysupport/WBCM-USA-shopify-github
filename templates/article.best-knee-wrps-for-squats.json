The sizing also includes a helpful metric of recommended weight, with 85-200 lbs and 140-230 lbs for the regular and long versions respectively.</p><p>The build quality is definitely above average, with some interesting quirks. The material is a mix of elastic and cotton. If you look closely, you’ll see it’s quite tight-knit, giving it excellent elasticity without movement restriction. However, common complaints among heavyweight athletes are that they’re too thin, resulting in lower compression and durability.</p>",
