We compared factors like durability, material, price vs. quality, comfort levels, and ease of use, and looked at other reviews to get a broader view.</p><p>After three workout sessions with moderate to high-intensity exercises, we got the list down to five best ones.

Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502892/\" target=\"_blank\">more men are going to the gym</a> and participating in weightlifting, although the gap has been shrinking in recent years thanks to destigmatization. As such, it can be difficult to find appropriately sized lifting straps for women, as most of the market is tailored towards men.</p><p>Moreover, the study comparing carpal bone size in men and women found that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15680553/\" target=\"_blank\">women had smaller wrists</a> than men on average. However, it points out that people of similar size, regardless of gender, would have similar-sized wrists.

Grip strength is a common weak point for athletes of various fitness levels. Unless specifically trained, it grows disproportionately to other muscles, often simply due to muscle size differences (think forearm muscles vs. trapezius, for example).</p><p>When lifting straps are on, they spread some of the weight away from your grip and onto your forearms. That way, you can use forearm strength to lift more weight. If you want to get even more specific, another study showed that lifting straps helped female lifters perform more deadlift reps <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/abstract/2023/10000/the_effect_of_lifting_straps_on_deadlift.2.aspx#:~:text=Results%20indicate%20that%20using%20LS,training%20involving%20the%20deadlift%20exercise.\" target=\"_blank\">by preserving grip strength</a>.</p><p>But this effect isn’t exclusive to weightlifting exercises. A similar effect is also transferable to other pull-based exercises like lateral pulldowns or pull-ups. That way, lifting straps can easily assist with small wrists bodybuilding, calisthenics, and more.</p><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"Avoid using lifting straps for lifts that are easily manageable for you. That way, you naturally develop grip strength and avoid overreliance on gear that might simply be unnecessary.\"</em></p><h3>2. Avoiding Injuries</h3><p>Research suggests that smaller wrist circumference is tied to an <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/23/7048\" target=\"_blank\">increased risk of fractures</a>, and this trend is more true among women. In addition to this data, female weightlifters report a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21590644/\" target=\"_blank\">higher rate of wrist and hand injuries</a> than male lifters.</p><p>By using lifting traps and reducing the chance of grip failure, we also avoid damage sustained by it, mitigating these long and short-term effects and keeping wrists healthier for longer.</p><h3>3. Mental Edge</h3><p>Studies looking at the effects of lifting straps on grip and performance also found that those who wore them also <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33306977/\" target=\"_blank\">had an improved perception of exertion and grip security</a>. In simple terms, their confidence in completing the lift was also higher, further suggesting the potential of using lifting straps for especially tough-to-manage lifts.</p><h2>When Do You Need Wrist Straps?</h2><p>Some people view lifting straps as cheating, especially in competitive environments. It’s not unheard of for them to be banned from lifting competitions due to their effects on grip and strength. That said, there are situations where they become more of a necessity than just a beneficial:</p>",

This is even more true for a small wrists female vs. an average-sized male. Moreover, this happens even more frequently when doing exercises with higher repetition numbers vs. simply 1-rep maxing. If you find this to be the case for you as well, consider adding lifting straps. </p><h3>2. Wrist Issues</h3><p>If you’re dealing with injuries such as fractures or medical conditions like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), you may struggle to maintain your grip during exercise. These conditions can cause discomfort and make gripping weights challenging. In such situations, using lifting straps can help alleviate pressure on your hands and wrists, making lifts more manageable.</p><p>Additionally, it's worth noting that female lifters tend to experience wrist injuries more frequently than male lifters, which further emphasizes the importance of wearing weight lifting wrist straps for women.</p><h3>3. Sensitive Skin</h3><p>An often-forgotten benefit of wearing lifting straps to alleviate grip pressure is the reduced tension on your palm skin. By displacing some of the weight from your palms and onto your forearms, you’ll sustain fewer and more manageable skin abrasions. Calluses especially come to mind. Although not set in stone, it’s a safe assumption that female lifters will care about this even more.</p><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"There’s no shame in using assistance gear if your physical well-being is a concern. Lift straps can make a big difference if you have any type of wrist issue.\"</em></p><h2>How to Choose Lifting Straps for Small Wrists (Women & Men)</h2><p>Consider the following factors when buying weight lifting wrist straps for women and men with smaller wrists:</p><h3>1. Strap Type</h3><p>Lasso lifting straps with an adjustable wrist fit are good pretty much across the board. Just narrow the fit down to your wrist and they’ll feel great. Olympic straps can be hit or miss depending on the length of the strap itself, but are generally pretty customizable, too.</p>",

Figure 8 straps are easy to slip into but are typically less tight-fitting, so sizing is crucial. The wrong size can prove unusable for a small wrists female, for example.</p><h3>2. Material</h3><p>Most lifting straps are made out of cotton, as it is a soft material that tends to fit well with all wrist shapes. Cotton straps shouldn’t be particularly abrasive even when under pressure, compared to something like leather. Leather straps are a bit more abrasive and can dig into the skin under high pressure, so it’s best to use them for single-repetition lifts.</p><h3>3. Exercise Type</h3><p>When it comes to multiple-repetition exercises, such as pulldowns or rows, consider using longer straps that loop around the handle or barbell, as they’re less likely to come. If you want something quick and easy to use for shorter weightlifting reps, figure 8 straps are a great choice. </p><h3>4. Durability</h3><p>Quality material and stitching play a big part in the durability of lifting straps. Look for reinforced stitching at key pressure points. Cotton is perfect for blending comfort and durability, tough leather straps are a bit more durable, but also more expensive.</p>",
