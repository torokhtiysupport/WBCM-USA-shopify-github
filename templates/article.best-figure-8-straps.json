So that is a good indicator that this accessory has been engineered to accommodate professionals at the elite level of weightlifting.</p><p>The figure-8 straps come in three sizes (small, medium, and large) and are specially designed to be used by both men and women. This can be seen by the wrist sizing they recommend – up to 7’’ for S, to 9’’ and upwards for size L, and size M occupying the sweet spot from 7–9 inches.</p><p>Regarding materials used, there are two options. Heavy-duty cotton, or high-quality elastane straps with a thick neoprene cushion around the wrist. Both are amazing options to buy. With that in mind, if you’re into very heavy lifting or you enjoy lifting often, then I recommend you opt for the cushioned version. The price difference isn’t much, but the cushion (which is not present in many lifting straps) is a real game changer. You can really feel its effects when lifting heavy.</p><p>In terms of longevity, the straps are reinforced with extra-quality stitching. This not only ensures that the straps will last you a long time, but also promotes safety during your deadlifts, rows, shrugs, pull-ups, and dumbbell squats.</p><p><a href=\"https://warmbody-coldmind.com/products/figure-8-lifting-straps?sca_ref=5120971.qSPHd7ePgJ\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://warmbody-coldmind.com/products/figure-8-lifting-straps?sca_ref=5120971.qSPHd7ePgJ\">They come in six design options</a>: white, black, pink, yellow, camo (military green, orange, grey, and black), and a chessboard (black and white) pattern. You cannot get the full color selection depending on the size you choose.</p><p>The straps might run a bit large, so ensure you consult the sizing chart. You want to ensure a good snug fit when using your straps. Well deserved top pick choice. Cannot go wrong with the WBCM figure 8 straps!</p>",

This gives them a few exciting properties: flexibility, moisture management, abrasion resistance, weight, and durability. Both cotton and nylon have their own sets of pros and cons when it comes to material characteristics, but they definitely do cover many weaknesses that the other material has.</p><p>For example, nylon is known for resilience and, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, which are all much higher than pure cotton. Cotton adds flexibility and comfort to the mix. Cotton is also good at absorbing moisture (sweat), while nylon isn’t, thus creating a material that will absorb sweat slower and dry more quickly.</p><p>These straps come in three sizes, as seen above, and they offer three color style options for personalization. They also come with extra stitching. And the average price tag (compared to others on this list) is not too much considering that the straps will likely last you a long time.</p><p>To further ease your mind on what mileage you’ll get out of these straps, you’ll also enjoy a 1-year warranty when you buy them. And given how well-made they are with the strong blend of materials, it is likely the straps will last you even longer. Great buy!</p>",
