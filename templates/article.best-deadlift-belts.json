Lower back injuries are especially common during deadlifts due to the possibility of misplacement and overstressing of the Lumbar <a href=\"https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lumbar_Vertebrae\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lumbar_Vertebrae\">Vertebrae</a> (lower spine).</p><p>When we brace for a lifting exercise, our core expands outwards. The purpose of <a href=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/weight-lifting-belt-vs-back-brace/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/weight-lifting-belt-vs-back-brace/\">a weightlifting belt</a> is to catch this expansion and act as a wall for the muscles to push against, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2709981/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2709981/\">increasing intra-abdominal pressure</a> (IAP). IAP, among other things, provides stability to the lower spine. For this reason, many lifters turn to belts as their back brace for deadlifts.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean a belt is always necessary when deadlifting. A belt is only really effective when we lift our maximums (over 75% of our max weight) or perform higher repetition numbers.</p><p>For beginners especially, it’s more important to focus on proper exercise technique and posture, saving weight belts for deadlift personal record attempts. Similarly, while the belt can enhance core stability, it’s not a substitution for core strength — if your core is not strong enough to support the weight, a belt won’t fix that.</p><h2>3 Benefits of Using a Belt For Deadlifting</h2><p>We already briefly touched on the effects of using a lifting belt for deadlifts. Now let’s go a bit more in-depth on the proven benefits:<br/></p><h3>1. Core Stability</h3><p>The main purpose of using weightlifting belts is to provide core stability to the wearer. Our core consists of <a href=\"https://www.physio-pedia.com/Core_Muscles#:~:text=The%20core%20is%20the%20group,the%20upper%20and%20lower%20body.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.physio-pedia.com/Core_Muscles#:~:text=The%20core%20is%20the%20group,the%20upper%20and%20lower%20body.\">multiple muscle groups</a> surrounding our hips and spine in a full 360 degrees. When we attempt to lift a heavy object off the ground, such as when deadlifting, these muscles activate to stabilize our spine and hips.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, wearing a belt creates intra-abdominal pressure, which prevents excessive movement and flexion of our core muscles. This helps us keep the core muscles in place, providing structure to the spine and pelvis and preventing unwanted movement that can cause us to lose lifting power and balance, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9282110/#:~:text=%5B1%2C2%5D%20It%20is,spinal%20injuries%20during%20weightlifting%20training.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9282110/#:~:text=%5B1%2C2%5D%20It%20is,spinal%20injuries%20during%20weightlifting%20training.\">lowering the chance of spinal injury</a>.</p>",

For example, loss of stability is one of the most common points of failure in weightlifting exercises. Once again, wearing a weightlifting belt increases pressure inside the erector spinae muscles in the lower back and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10619094/#:~:text=Wearing%20abdominal%20belts,during%20lifting%20exertions.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10619094/#:~:text=Wearing%20abdominal%20belts,during%20lifting%20exertions.\">makes the upper body feel more rigid</a>.</p><p>When the pressure inside these muscles goes up, it helps stabilize the lower part of the Lumbar Vertebrae (lower spine).

While most are made to cover a variety of exercises, some are more specialized, such as the Spud Inc. Pro Series Deadlift Belt. With that in mind, here are the basic ways to differentiate weightlifting belts.</p><h3>1. By Material</h3><p>The first way to differentiate between weightlifting belts is their main construction material. The two most common options on the market include leather or nylon. Here’s a simple table comparison between the two:</p>",

By Fastening Mechanism</h3><p>The fastening mechanism used by the belt can determine factors like mobility and adjustability, as well as durability and longevity. The three most common systems include the standard belt buckle, a hook & loop velcro, or a closing lever. </p><p>The belt buckle needs no introduction since we’re familiar with it from daily life. It’s most common on leather belts and typically uses one or two prongs — the former being cheaper, the latter being more durable. It’s easy to adjust, though the fit will not always be perfect due to the spacing between the holes. Higher-quality belts will use materials like stainless steel, making it highly durable too.</p>",

The idea of them is simple — wrap the belt around and tighten it to your desired fit, then simply loop the velcro strap back around to fuse it.</p><p>The level of adjustability is the highest between the three since you can adjust it in literal millimeters until you find your fit. However, this type of mechanism tends to wear down more easily with use and isn’t as good at withstanding high levels of exercise pressure.</p><p>Finally, we have the lever mechanisms. These are typically found on premium belts and made from high-quality metals. Initially, they require you to set them up by screwing the mechanism into the body of the belt. It can take a few attempts of assembly and disassembly before you find your fit.</p><p>Levers can be fastened and unfastened with literally a single hand motion, but they’re not adjustable on the go, meaning you can’t adjust your fit between exercises unless you literally have a screwdriver on you. That said, when the fit is right, the durability of them is unmatched.</p><p>Note that these are the three most common types and that there are exceptions. For example, both the Element26 and Spud Inc. belts we mentioned in this article tried a unique approach, netting them their own advantages and disadvantages. However, commercial weightlifting belts overwhelmingly use one of the three we mentioned.</p>",

A belt that is too tight will put too much pressure when your core expands, which can have the inverse effect of wearing a belt. Likewise, having a belt that is too big can fail to capture the core expansion, which defeats the purpose of wearing one.</p><p>To get the right size, measure around the peak of your core midsection, then refer to the manufacturer’s sizing chart. Luckily, most belts can be adjusted to fit a variety of sizes, so being off by half an inch won’t be detrimental.</p><h3>3. Durability</h3><p>Before you select your belt, it’s important to assess what you’ll be using it for. That way, you can ensure it can withstand the exercises you’re going to perform. Simply put, you can’t expect the same level of durability from a nylon belt with a velcro closure as you can from a leather one with a lever closing system.</p><p>Then again, you don’t have to overspend on a highly durable belt meant for powerlifting if you do the occasional 40-70% rep max squat or deadlift.</p><h3>4. Competitive Certification</h3><p>If you have competitive aspirations or simply want to train like the pros, it’s best to get a belt that comes in standardized competition sizing, or better year has been certified by one of the leading competitive bodies. For example, the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) has an official list of approved gear.</p><p>Meanwhile, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF), the governing body of the Summer Olympic Games weightlifting division, allows the use of belts as long as they’re visible above the costume and don’t exceed 12 cm in width.</p><h2>How to Wear a Belt Properly for Deadlifting?</h2><p>If you’re new to weightlifting belts, you might assume that they’re worn the same as a regular clothing belt. However, a weightlifting belt is not meant to be worn around your waistline. Instead, it should be positioned above the hip bones but under your rib cage.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to wearing a lifting belt for deadlifts:</p><ol><li>Start by standing up straight and relaxing your body</li><li>Position the belt so that it sits between your ribs and hips and covers your stomach area</li><li>Ensure that the center of the belt aligns with your lower back</li><li>Fasten the belt using the closure mechanism</li><li>Tighten the belt but be careful not to overdo it, you should be able to slide a couple of fingers inside</li><li>Check the belt’s position, make sure it’s sitting evenly across</li><li>Take the exercise position and breathe in to brace, but don’t lift yet</li><li>Assess the tightness in the ready position and readjust if necessary. The belt should be tight enough that you feel the pressure from it, but it shouldn’t interfere with the core expansion. If you feel it cutting into you, it’s too tight and should be loosened.</li></ol>",

As discussed throughout the article, using a belt only becomes effective once they start lifting close to their physical maximum or do large numbers of repetitions at a sizable weight.</p><h3>What Do You Wear Under a Deadlift Belt?</h3><p>Experienced lifters wear tight-fitting workout clothing under their weightlifting belt. Most often, they use compression garments to activate the muscles and stimulate blood flow.</p><p>Bulky and oversized clothing can interfere with the snug fit of the belt or simply catch into the fastening mechanism, making them inconvenient to wear under lifting belts.</p><h3>What Size Deadlift Belt Should I Get?</h3><p>First, stand up straight and measure the peak of your midsection with a tape measure. Take the number and refer to the manufacturer size chart. Since belts have adjustable width, you’ll be able to find the right size.</p><p>Note that sizing charts are not universal, meaning, for example, that not everybody’s size M is the same. If you plan on switching brands, redo the measuring process before purchasing.</p><h3>What Is The Best Belt Thickness For Deadlifts?</h3><p>The thickness of a deadlift weight belt depends on several factors, most importantly, your size and the weight you lift. A 6mm belt will offer a good blend of flexibility with ample support, which is sufficient for the majority of recreational weightlifters. Powerlifters and athletes of larger proportions may seek extra support due to the typically higher weight lifted, so a 10 or 13-mm belt may be more suitable for them.</p>",
