However, this system does come with a drawback — the ratchet is not as tightly sealed as a buckle or lever, leaving a bit of an opening on the front.</p><p>Having the front open means it won’t provide the same 360-degree support as other belts, which can be detrimental in some higher mobility lifts (such as clean & jerk or overhead press).

It’s reinforced with contrasting double stitching, providing structural integrity and a nice black-on-white aesthetic. Instead of using a belt buckle or lever, Element26 decided to incorporate a nylon and velcro strap with hook & loop closure, thus creating the “hybrid” belt.</p>",
