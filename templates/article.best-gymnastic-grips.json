When a gymnast grips a bar, they apply pressure to their palm, and as the palm slides and rolls across the bar, it causes friction between the skin and the gripped surface. It can cause different kinds of friction-related injuries, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12074526/#:~:text=Corns%20and%20calluses%20result%20from%20hyperkeratosis%2C%20a%20normal%20physiologic%20response%20of%20the%20skin%20to%20chronic%20excessive%20pressure%20or%20friction.\" target=\"_blank\">particularly corns and calluses</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.sportsmd.com/sports-injuries/wrist-hand-injuries/blister-treatment/#:~:text=Gymnasts%20are%20especially%20susceptible%20to,significant%20problem%20in%20this%20population.\" target=\"_blank\">blisters</a> forming on your hands.</p><p>Grips are useful in two ways. Firstly, they act as cushioning between the palm and the gripped object, reducing the direct pressure on the palm. Secondly, they add a protective layer between the skin and the object's surface, reducing friction. It’s important to mention that grips are not a foolproof solution, but they can make things better.</p><h2>Who Needs Gymnastics Grips?</h2><p>The need for wearing grips is an ongoing debate, and there isn’t a right or wrong answer. <a href=\"https://wewi-rapporten.utwente.nl/394/1/2700.Bosan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gymnastics bars can be quite slippery</a>, and athlete safety is consistently being explored, with grips in combination with chalk being a common suggestion. However, some professional gymnasts, such as Lena Degteva, <a href=\"https://gymcastic.com/transcripts/episode-17-transcript/#:~:text=LENA%3A%20Personally%2C%20to,the%20lesser%20evil.\" target=\"_blank\">argue against them</a> and prefer the raw approach for developing natural skin resistance.</p><p>Today, some coaches recommend beginners to train without them to get a good feel for the bar first but slowly introduce them as the athlete goes into more advanced tricks and routines.</p>",

Additionally, there’s nothing technically stopping you from using them since they’re allowed in mainstream competitions. You’ll see Olympic gymnasts perform both with and without them.</p><h2>Main Grip Types</h2><p>Here are some examples of differences between gymnastics bar hand grips. This should help you better understand which ones to get:</p><h3>1. Material</h3><p>Traditionally, gymnastics grips were made of leather, with the smooth side gracing the palm while the suede side touches the bar. The rough surface of the suede offers more traction and is more resistant to friction tears. Additionally, suede is naturally more moisture-absorbent, meaning it’s less likely to slip on potential sweat stains found on the bar.</p><p>You’ll find grips made from both real and faux leather. The former is more expensive and higher quality on average but harder to break in. Faux leather is typically more affordable and less stiff, though durability can vary significantly from brand to brand. In modern times, we’ve also seen the rise of synthetic materials like carbon fiber or microfiber, often acting as a faux leather variant.</p><p>These materials can be a bit stickier, which can be both a good or bad thing depending on your preferences. They may not offer as fast and smooth of a transition as leather, but you might feel the grip more securely. In addition, they’re commonly infused with some sort of padding such as foam to make them softer on the palm. If speed specifically isn’t a high concern for you, you might find these more fitting.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h3>2. Hole vs. No-Hole</h3><p>Gymnastics bar hand grips come with both hole and no-hole options. Grips that feature finger holes, whether it’s two or three, offer a more secure fit and prevent them from shifting around in the hand during the routine. However, depending on your grip spread and finger thickness, for example, holes can feel constricting.</p><p>Some gymnasts prefer the no-hole option because it offers greater freedom for the fingers. That said, this leaves the chance of grips shifting around or bending during your routine, which can expose your skin and thus defeat the purpose of wearing grips.</p><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"With holed versions of gymnastics grips, you have the flexibility to use them as if they were the no-hole variety. Simply refrain from inserting your fingers through the holes, or use only the number of holes that suits your preference.\"</em></p><h3>3. Buckle vs. Hook & Loop (Velcro Strap)</h3><p>The choice of wrist closure on workout grips mostly comes down to a traditional buckle or a hook & loop with a Velcro strap for security. So, what’s the difference? A buckle system is typically more durable and expensive than simple Velcro. The chance of it coming undone is practically non-existent unless the buckle is damaged somehow.</p><p>However, depending on your wrist shape and size, you might not be able to find the ideal fitting hole, making these less comfortable to wear. Meanwhile, the sticky Velcro strap typically seen on gym grips does not have constrictions on how tight or loose it can fit. Additionally, the back of the strap is typically covered in some sort of foam padding to relieve pressure from the wrist.</p><p>This combination allows you to find the exact fit for your wrist, allowing for superior comfort. These grips are also more affordable on average, though Velcro straps tend to wear out over time (become less sticky), warranting sooner replacement.</p><h3>4. Dowel vs. Non-Dowel Beginner Grips</h3><p>You’ve probably noticed that some gymnastics grips have small horizontal bars on them. These are called dowels. Dowel grips for gymnastics are primarily used to depressurize the fingers, adding another layer of protection. They also act as a sort of hook, latching onto the bar and adding spin that a hand alone cannot achieve due to its uneven shape.</p>",

While more seamless transitions sound great, it’s highly debated whether or not to use them. Technically, they’re not barred from competitive use, so you don’t have to worry about that.</p><p>However, they’re primarily used by advanced gymnasts, for example, for adding momentum to maintain fast-paced routines. When it comes to beginner grips for gymnastics, it’s often recommended to start without dowels and develop synergy with the bar, while the speed and control come naturally with muscle memory.</p><h2>How to Choose The Best Grips for Gymnastics?</h2><p>Here are the factors to consider when searching for the best hand grips for you.</p><h3>1. Material</h3><p>As mentioned previously, your options for material boil down to leather, its faux variants, or a synthetic material. Real leather can be more durable and visually appealing, though it can cost a premium. Synthetic materials are cheaper but aren’t necessarily worse.</p><h3>2. Comfort</h3><p>Extra padding and adjustable straps help but fit is paramount. Take good care to measure your palm and refer to the size chart. It doesn’t matter how much padding you add if the grips bend in your hand and interfere with your workout.</p><h3>3. Design</h3><p>It’s okay to choose a product that grabs your attention visually, as long as it fits your needs in terms of size, hole numbers, and type of fastening mechanism. Feel free to shop around, some brands offer various color options too.</p><h3>4. Durability</h3><p>Durability will often be a reflection of the materials used and price. Leather grips with metal buckles will cost more than faux leather with velcro straps, though it’s expected that the former lasts longer. Consider the balance of durability and cost.</p>",

However, that’s not always the case with gymnastics grips. Some options are simply more expensive due to brand recognition, for example. Cheaper options can offer just as good quality for the price, so don’t take it at face value and check the specs.</p><h2>How to Wear Gymnastics Hand Grips for Bars?</h2><p>Here’s how you put on gymnastics bar hand grips:</p><h3>1. Placement</h3><p>Start by sliding your grips over the hand and place the closure mechanism on top of your wrist, but don’t tighten yet. If there are finger holes present, fit your fingers first. Fasten the closure and then stretch the material out to make sure it’s evenly spread across the palm without creases.</p><p>If a dowel is present, make sure it faces the hand and sits on the middle portion of your fingers, between the joint bends. Once you’re happy with how it sits in your hand, tighten the strap or buckle to a desired fit.</p><h3><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3><p><em><strong>\"</strong></em><em>The fit of the fastening mechanism should be tight enough not to slide up and down. That said, be mindful of blood flow. You should be able to comfortably bend and twist your wrist without pain or discomfort.\"</em></p><h3>2. Test & Readjust</h3><p>Once you have them on, give them a test run on some basic warmup drills. Hand from the bar and take a few swings to see how they feel. Now is also the time to readjust the fit to avoid hurting yourself.</p><h2>Breaking in New Grips Quickly</h2><p>Classic gymnastics grips for bars are typically made of leather or suede (or faux variants). Initially, they can be quite stiff, resisting palm bending. This can make them uncomfortable to wear until broken in. Trying a complex routine with them out of the box can cause skin damage, especially around the finger holes.</p>",

For now, make the roll as wide as necessary, avoiding too much force application on the material. Next, wrap them around the bar or ring and roll them back and forth. After a few repetitions, try putting them on to check how they feel.</p><p>Perform simple hand movements like curving your palm and fingers. Once they loosen, try hanging or swinging on a bar. If still stiff, apply leather or suede conditioner, avoiding forceful bending to prevent cracks and tears.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Are Carbon or Leather Grips Better?</h3><p>Classic leather hand grips offer a smoother roll and a snugger hold but break easier with frequent use. Conversely, carbon grips provide reduced friction (which can be a good or bad thing depending on if you want speed or grip), but are generally more durable and sweat-resistant, making them a notable alternative. The ultimate choice comes down to personal preference.</p><h3>What Brand of Gymnastics Grips Should I Buy?</h3><p>For classic leather hand grips, <a href=\"https://warmbody-coldmind.com/products/leather-hand-grips-basic?sca_ref=5120971.qSPHd7ePgJ\" target=\"_blank\">Warm Body Cold Mind</a> is the perfect choice. For carbon fiber grips, we recommend <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/bear-komplex-3-hole-hand-grips-carbon-fiber/?a_aid=62ff8b7e519eb\" target=\"_blank\">Bear Komplex</a>.</p><h3>How to Take Good Care of Gymnastics Grips?</h3><p>Wipe your leather hand grips down after each use to remove excess sweat. Use a leather brush to dust off chalk particles. Avoid soap and water but feel free to use a dedicated leather/suede cleaning solution. Air dry them but don’t leave them out in the sun or high heat to prevent shrinkage and cracks.</p>",

A gymnastics routine consists of swinging, pirouettes (rolling), gripping & catching, and various other movements that cause friction between the bar and palm skin. To avoid skin damage such as burns, calluses, or blisters from said friction, adding a protective layer is advised.</p><p>While there are gymnasts who prefer a raw approach and opt for chalk only, rest assured that both beginners and pros wear gymnastics hand grips for bars and rings especially.
