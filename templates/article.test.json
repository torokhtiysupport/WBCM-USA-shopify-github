Of course, it always comes down to personal preference and the type of workouts you do. Still, you can’t argue with the fact that figure 8 lifting straps are super effective. The grip is secure and their design makes them not only easy to use, but they do a great job at supporting your wrists.</p><p>So, let’s see which eleven are currently the best and if they’re something that would help your workouts.</p><p><strong>Let’s strap!</strong></p>",
