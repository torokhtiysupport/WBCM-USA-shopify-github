You can do your lifts without even thinking the weightlifting finger tape will fall off, it stays securely in place no matter how long you work out for.</p><p>You always want thumb tape to be tearable and stretchy, and this one is both. It’s easy to tear a piece off and it’s also easy to adjust it because it stretches quite a bit. If you get a thick, stiff tape, it may be better when it comes to durability, but you’ll have a really hard time adjusting it. Most likely, you won’t even be able to adjust it properly and then you won’t get the benefits a grip tape provides, so always look for something stretchy. </p><p>Its hold is flexible, but secure. The glue is strong enough to prevent any shifting, but it also leaves absolutely no residue. Shifting is a pain and not only because it’s uncomfortable. If your tape shifts, you’ll spend a lot of time readjusting; time that would be better spent lifting.</p>",

Well, the name has nothing to do with Halloween and I completely get why they named it that – this is so sticky, it IS scary.</p><p>If the strength of the adhesive is your priority, then there’s no tape better for you than this one.

This one won’t move no matter what you do to it, and it’s a bit of a hassle to remove. The glue on it really is unique, and I don’t know of a manufacturer that offers anything stronger.</p>",

            "product_text_content_2": "<p>It’s latex-free and made from cotton, which I always appreciate because it’s great at sweat absorption. The thing with cotton is, it doesn’t stretch, so most tapes come in a cotton-spandex blend. I really wish this one came in a blend, too, because it doesn’t stretch nearly as much as I think it should. You can wrap it around your fingers fine, but it’s just not as comfortable as it should be. </p><p>But once you get it on, its performance is unmatched. You’ll feel it a little on your fingers, but you can sweat all you want and apply as much pressure as you wish – this tape isn’t going anywhere. It holds up to heat, friction, sweat, tension… Literally anything. There is some room for improvement with the Goat Scary Sticky tape, of course, but this is still one of the best sticky tapes you can find.</p>",
