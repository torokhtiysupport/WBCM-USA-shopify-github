You can do your lifts without even thinking the weightlifting finger tape will fall off, it stays securely in place no matter how long you work out for.</p><p>You always want thumb tape to be tearable and stretchy, and this one is both. It’s easy to tear a piece off and it’s also easy to adjust it because it stretches quite a bit. If you get a thick, stiff tape, it may be better when it comes to durability, but you’ll have a really hard time adjusting it. Most likely, you won’t even be able to adjust it properly and then you won’t get the benefits a grip tape provides, so always look for something stretchy. </p><p>Its hold is flexible, but secure. The glue is strong enough to prevent any shifting, but it also leaves absolutely no residue. Shifting is a pain and not only because it’s uncomfortable. If your tape shifts, you’ll spend a lot of time readjusting; time that would be better spent lifting.</p>",

It's basically a special way of holding the barbell or bar to improve grip strength and reduce the chance of slipping. <br/>With hook grip, you grip the barbell with your thumb under your fingers, which creates a 'hook' with the thumb around the bar. This results in a more secure way to hold the bar.</p>",

But it has quite a few benefits that can ultimately lead to your performance being improved. It will make the workout more comfortable, and you won't have to worry about the bar slipping from your hands, And those nasty blisters and calluses? You'll have way less of them (if any!) if you decide to give the tape a try.</p><h3>1. Better Grip Stability</h3><p>The tape makes the surface tacky and prevents any slipping that would be caused by chalk or sweat. Essentially, it improves grip stability and allows you to have a very strong hold on the barbell.</p><h3>2. Less Friction</h3><p>Since you have the tape as the protective barrier between the barbel and the skin, you won’t feel as much friction. The tape will also prevent blisters, abrasions, and calluses.</p><h3>3. More Thumb Comfort</h3><p>You’ve probably noticed that the tape is usually applied to the thumb. The hook grip technique is not the most comfortable and the tape will protect the thumb from the pressure coming from the bar. This makes the technique more tolerable.</p><h3>4. Improved Confidence</h3><p>If your grip is secure, you can focus on your technique and not worry about slipping or accidents.</p>",

It’s pretty simple – if the glue is not strong enough, the tape will shift or completely fall off. However, glue that’s too strong will leave residue and will be hard to remove. You want something in between – strong enough to stay in place, but not as strong where it will be hard to remove.</p><h3>2. Material</h3><p>You want a cotton-spandex blend. Anywhere from 5% to 25% spandex is great, but don’t go over 25%. If your tape is too stretchy, it won’t work well. This is also the case with it being too stiff – it will be uncomfortable and hard to adjust.</p>",

Easily Applicable</h3><p>Good tape is easy to tear, and it won’t leave any frays behind it. If you see a tape that needs to be cut with scissors, it doesn’t mean that it’s bad, but who really wants to have to have scissors as part of their gym equipment?</p><h3>5. Non-allergenic</h3><p>If your skin is sensitive or if you’re allergic to latex, make sure to get non-allergenic tape. When you combine sensitive skin, sweat and tape that can cause allergies.</p>",
