This is the sort of material you’d see on professional diving suits. It offers excellent support and warmth, making the shorts a reliable choice for athletes working out both indoors and outdoors. You can easily use these both for a cold swim session, outdoor run, or weightlifting. The only drawback is that they might feel a bit too warm at times, particularly if you work out in the summer heat.</p><p>Their mid-rise design is meant to be unisex, but it does come with a lack of proper contouring specific for male and female bodies.
