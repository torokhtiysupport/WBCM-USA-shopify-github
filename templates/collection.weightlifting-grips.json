The padded section should be against your palm, and the strap should wrap around your wrist well.<\/p><p>Adjust the fit and grip to make them moderately snug for better support. Place your hands around the bar to check whether the grips improve the contact between your hands and the bar itself for better hold.<\/p><p>When lifting and pulling, you'd better curve the grip portion into your palm as it wraps around the bar.
