There’s some dust, of course, but it’s minimal. It will keep your hands nice and dry even if you tend to sweat a lot, and you don’t need much of it. The powder is very fine and even and feels comfortable on your hands.

            "product_text_content_1": "<p>Sportmediq’s idea was to create a very effective and long-lasting chalk that would be easy to apply without making a mess. This chalk has a consistency that feels like a lotion, and it dries in 15-25 seconds.</p><p>If you get liquid chalk, you expect it to come out of the bottle and into your palm without getting anywhere else. This, however, is not the case here because once you open the bottle, there’s a lot of chalk that comes out, and since there’s so much of it, it gets everywhere. The consistency is very nice, and it dries quickly, but the mess it makes is surprising and you don’t expect it from liquid chalk. Not to mention, the bottle gets messy too, because the chalk gets all over it, so it doesn’t stay looking clean for a long time. </p><p>Nevertheless, the grip it provides is really good and reliable, but it doesn’t last very long. You’ll need to reapply this after every set, and if your hands sweat a lot, you’ll have a hard time applying the chalk directly onto sweaty palms because it won’t stick. Make sure to pat your hands dry with a towel and then apply chalk. This way, you’ll have no issues with it sticking to your skin.</p>",

            "product_text_content_2": "<p>It doesn’t leave a lot of traces on the equipment and won’t get onto your clothes, so that’s a plus. It’s also not very drying, so your skin won’t suffer, and since you need to reapply it often, this is a bonus because imagine how cracked your hands would get otherwise. This chalk is a good choice for people with dry hands, who usually struggle with using chalk.  </p><p>It has a nice fresh scent, which, although the scent is not the most important thing in the world, makes applying the chalk more pleasant.</p><p>Overall, this is a good alternative to block chalk because you won’t inhale any chalk particles, but if you’re expecting something super long-lasting that won’t make a mess, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>",
