To fix it to a bar you just need to apply pressure to the handles on the sides of the spring to expand the collar diameter. Once you adjust the diameter, you can slide the collar across the bar and release the handles to secure the collar properly.<\/p><p>The main advantage of spring collars is their affordability: they will only cost you $20. It's also easy and fast to slide them onto the bar. It makes them useful especially if you’re working out with weights and adjusting them regularly.<\/p><p>Since you can slide on and off them quickly, they’re ideal for cross-training sessions where you often switch weights.<\/p><p>They provide a secure grip when they’re new, but gradually lose their strength over time and need to be replaced. Also, spring collars can damage the finish on the sleeves. <\/p><p>Speaking about the drawbacks, the main con refers to their low price. They won't work well for such intensive and dynamic movements as in cross-training and Olympic lifts. So, you can use them for regular training with moderate intensity.
