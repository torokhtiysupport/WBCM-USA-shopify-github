You'll definitely benefit from these accessories, you just need to know how to utilize them to get the most out of your training.</p><p>Wrists have quite a complex structure, which is why they should have a high mobility degree to ensure the smooth functioning of the entire hand. However, high mobility can lead to less stability and a higher risk of wrist injury.</p><p>When lifting heavy weights, great forces influence the wrist, especially when snatching, jerking, and doing classic strength exercises, such as front squats and push presses. The main purpose of lifting wraps is to stabilize the wrists, reduce the risk of injury, and prevent tension and overload. </p><p>Like lifting straps, wrist wraps can help you to lift more weight. When using straps, you attach them to the bar, while the wraps wrap around your wrist providing more stability. The reason why you can lift more is your ability to keep your wrist closer to a straight, more neutral alignment, allowing more force to be applied through that joint.</p><p>Overall, it's easy to wrap the accessory around the wrists. However, you should make sure that they sit well around the wrists: not too deep and not too loose to bring the desired degree of stability.</p>",

If you want to limit the motion, try using thicker Velcro wraps that provide better support while dealing with heavier weights overhead. </li><li>Another option is cotton wraps that are thinner and more flexible for lighter weights. They are also suitable when you want the wrists to be more free in the motion ability.</li><li>Don’t place them over the wrist joints. Placing them too far onto the forearm gives minimal support, so there's a possibility that you could get excessive wrist extension. If the wraps cover the joint line, it may cause dysfunctional movement in the wrist extension position, as in a handstand.</li></ul><h2>5 Benefits of Using Wrist Wraps</h2><p>Every lifter who treats the training regime will never neglect using lifting garments. The reason is having the proper equipment will improve their performance, eliminate fatigue, and mitigate injury risk. </p><p>Every weightlifter, powerlifter, cross-training athlete, and bodybuilder will use wrist wraps to boost their grip strength, preserve stability, and facilitate stamina while working out with heavier weights. Let's enumerate the benefits of this useful lifting gear:</p><h3>1. Prevent Muscular Fatigue and Small Muscle Exhaustion</h3><p>When training not every muscle group loses its strength and function at the same rate. Usually, smaller stabilizing muscles tire out first, then the larger primary movers will be exhausted.</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30962121/\" target=\"_blank\">The research</a> on this issue indicated no great age-group differences in wrist joint proprioception rate of change, and total muscle fatigue rate was found. There was a statistically mild correlation between wrist joint position sense rate of change and total muscle fatigue rates.</p><p>The study displayed that pre-exercise and post-exercise testing consisted of active wrist joint position sense, hand grip, and wrist extensor strength. Moreover, postexercise wrist joint position sense test scores were much higher than pre-exercise ones. Exercises induced statistically significant total muscle fatigue rates.</p>",

Let's analyze a bench press exercise when the load is constantly at 70%. At the start of the set, your wrists will be stacked squarely on top of one another. However, as you continue to perform more sets, the little forearm muscles that stabilize the wrist will fatigue soon.</p><p>To avoid this issue, don’t neglect wearing this lifting gear for better grip support, so you’ll be able to train consistently for a longer period. This will lead to increased strength and muscle mass due to enhanced endurance. </p><h3>2. Preserving Joint Stability</h3><p>When lifting weights, our joints experience great strain. Even when slightly angled forward or backward, our wrists are under big tension. The wrist wraps restrict the movement in the wrists, thus supporting it while carrying the weights.</p><p>However, when lifting heavy loads, you want to focus on driving the barbell as fast as possible. In this case, your brain is telling the muscles to work and push faster, but unfortunately, your poor wrist mechanics make you step back. </p><p>The better stability you feel in the wrists, the more you can push through the arms. If your wrists are weak and move under the load, it will limit the overall pressing strength. To strengthen the wrists, do not neglect wearing this gear during heavy overhead lifts with low reps, for example, while performing overhead squats to facilitate the body’s balance and core strength. </p>",

Enabling to Work Out with Heavier Weights</h3><p>When you hold the barbell with a firm grip, you'll feel the weight lighter, increasing your self-assurance while lifting heavier loads.</p><p>The sense of proprioception is the body’s awareness of its surroundings, particularly when holding a barbell, which means that the weight and our position in space are communicating with our brain. Stiff muscles help to develop better proprioception. Thus, wrist wraps will ensure a firm grip to feel the weight better.</p><h3>4. Mitigating Muscle Strain and Preventing Injuries</h3><p>Wrist wraps will help to feel less strain on the forearm area and also get a firmer grip on the bar, contributing to managing the sense of weight in your hands while you lift. Wrist strains are a common injury in weightlifters and cross-trainers. Fortunately, the wrist is a resilient joint, and after proper rest and mobilization, you can begin putting loads back on it.</p><p>A benefit of wrist wraps is that they can facilitate the recovery process by supporting good form. A good wrap will both improve wrist stability and take strain off your wrist joints. As injury swelling and tension go away, you can stop using wraps and let your wrists continue to heal and strengthen themselves.</p><h3>5. Minimizing Wrist Bending during the Dynamic Workout</h3><p>Such exercises like snatches, cleans, and jerks require better wrist support that wrist wraps can easily provide if worn properly. Proper lifting garments are lifting accessories that provide the best wrist support for powerlifting and help athletes lift weights while experiencing some level of pain or discomfort in the wrists.</p><p>The reason for this pain is wrist bending or flexing, and wraps can provide the rigidity that is necessary to keep the joints neutral. </p>",

Avoid using them when you're warming up as this lifting gear serves well to prevent overloads. So, you'd better not carry them during the whole workout.</p><p>When doing cleans or front squats, mobility, and stability work together and complement each other. If you have poor mobility skills, simply using wrist wraps or bandages won't improve it. Thus, you should work on improving wrist and shoulder mobility.</p><p>The thing is that our wrists are designed to move into the extension position required to hold a barbell, a handstand, or a push-up position. They're also designed to withstand compressive loads (for example, while handstanding). </p><p>If you have an injury or the weight is too heavy, you’d better use the wrist support. However, generally, wait until you get accustomed to the load to avoid wearing wrist wraps, just not to become reliant on them.</p><h2>Are Wrist Wraps Approved for Competition?</h2><p>In powerlifting, every federation has its own rules regarding what is allowed and what isn't forbidden to wear for competitions. So, it may seem a little bit confusing. </p><p>When it comes to discussing the rules regarding powerlifting gear, an athlete should know well which apparel and accessories are allowed to wear and use for competitions.

By combining fabrics with elastic, wrist wraps can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6755327/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6755327/\">provide great support and grip activity</a> with enough wrist flexibility making them comfortable and easy to use. While some wrist wraps may be made of leather, making them very durable, but less comfortable.</p><h3><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3><p><em><strong>\"</strong></em><em>There are two popular types of wraps on the market: thinner and more flexible cotton wrap and thicker Velcro powerlifting-style wraps, which offer greater wrist support. Wear the thicker wraps if you intend to maximize your lifting movements, such as bench and shoulder presses.<br/><br/>However, if you aim to gain your maximum in Clean & Jerk or Snatch, the thinner wraps may be a better option. They provide more range of motion at the wrist. You must be able to extend your wrist, and the wrist will be slightly extended at the finish position of both the Snatch and Jerk.\"</em></p><h3>2. Length</h3><p>When you choose the length of the wrist wraps for lifting weights, consider your wrist size. There are wraps between 12” and 36” in length. The longer the wraps, the more turns you need to make to secure it around the wrists. As usual, longer wraps will always be stiffer than shorter ones.</p><h3>3. Stiffness</h3><p>Wrap stiffness may vary depending on the number of elastic fibers they feature. Remember: the stiffer the wraps, the more weight you can lift. However, stiff wraps are not so comfortable and compressing, making them not so perfect for beginners.</p><h3>4. Closure Type</h3><p>You can find wraps tightened with velcro that are approved for competition, providing maximum support and preventing wrist injury. Some brands have secondary elastic bands stitched to the main part of the wrap. However, velcro is faster and more convenient to adjust.</p><h3>5. Thumb Loop Availability </h3><p>Thumb loops provide extra wrist support by making tightening the wraps much easier. </p><h2>How to Use Powerlifting Wrist Wraps Correctly?</h2><p>It seems that it's easy to wear wrist wraps: you just need to tie them properly and you’re ready to go. However, it's important to know how to wear this garment correctly to make your training session easier and more beneficial.

If you do everything right, it will be difficult to drop the wrists backward during the lift. This will decrease the risk of injuries, strains, and pain.</p><h3>2. Don’t Wrap Too Low or Too High</h3><p>If you plan to compete, follow the placement mentioned in the IPF technical rules: you need the wraps to stop after extending 2 cm into your palm. Also, they should cover 10 cm, starting from the center of the wrist joint.</p><p>Generally, this position guarantees ultimate performance and getting the best results.

You can avoid discomfort, preserve a secure fit, and benefit from your wraps.</p><h3>2. Not Wrapping Tight Enough</h3><p>Don't be afraid of wrapping your wrists tight enough to get ultimate wrist support. The tightness rate may vary from athlete to athlete and depends on your lift specification. Aim for a snug fit that will keep your wrap in place avoiding blood circulation restriction. </p><h3>3. Wrapping Too High on Your Wrists</h3><p>When you wrap your wrist wraps too high, most of the wrap ends up above the wrist joint. It can restrict your grip's ability to open and close, but more importantly, it decreases your wrist stability. To solve this issue, check whether the center of your wrap is aligned with your wrist joint. </p><h3>4. Wrapping Too Tight</h3><p>Too tight wrap can restrict blood flow to your hands and won’t allow you to fully close your hands, thus affecting grip strength. </p><p>Different lifts require different tightness rates. For example, heavy bench presses require wrist stability with minimal flexibility. While exercises like snatches require wrist support and some level of flexibility.</p><p>Unlike with lifting straps, you need mobility in your wrists. If you wear your wrist wrap too tight, you might not be able to promote the wrist flexibility needed to complete the lift.  </p><h3>5. Wrapping Too Low</h3><p>Wrapping too low has a similar effect as wrapping too high: you won’t have proper support in your wrist because you are not covering the joint well. </p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<p>Lifting straps are like grips that help you to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33306977/\" target=\"_blank\">hold more weights during deadlifts, shrugs, bent-over rows, etc</a>. Considering that grip strength can be a limiting factor during multiple sets of various pulling exercises such as deadlifts, lifting straps can affect mechanical performance, grip strength, perceived exertion, grip security, and power.</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33306977/\" target=\"_blank\">The study</a> showed that the use of lifting straps during deadlifts ensures better grip strength, faster grip strength recovery following training, and greater perceived grip security and power than deadlifts performed without lifting straps, while also boosting mechanical performance.</p><h3><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3><p><strong>\"</strong><em>If you want more flexibility in your wrists, you will need a wrap made from cotton. The cotton material will provide some support, but it won’t allow you to stretch the material for a tighter wrap. Thus, you’ll get some wrist movement under the load.</em></p><p><em>Despite most lifters using a rigid wrap, there are some reasons why you should opt for a more flexible wrap. For example, if you are an Olympic weightlifter or</em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10502967/\" target=\"_blank\"><em> cross-training athlete who performs movements like Snatches and Clean & Jerks, you will need more movement in the wrist</em></a><em> to “catch” those exercises overhead properly.  </em></p><p><em>Thus, unless you prefer practicing those exercises, choose a more rigid wrap, which is also more versatile in the gym.</em><strong>\"</strong></p><h3>2. Material</h3><p>Lifting straps are non-stretchy nylon with extra cushioning neoprene padding for long training sessions. Wrist wraps combine elastic material with polyester or something similar. </p><h3>3. Application</h3><p>Wrist wraps are easy to put on: loop it around your thumb, wrap around your wrist, and lock in with a Velcro. Lifting straps takes a bit more time and knowledge on how to put your hands into the loops. Then, you should wrap the fabric around the dumbbell or a barbell and grip it. </p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How Long Do Wrist Wraps Last?</h3><p>Wrist wraps can last for 4-5 months depending on frequency of use and how well you maintain them. To prolong the wrist wrap's lifespan you need to treat them properly. You should wash them regularly, on average after every third session, keep them free from snags and tears, and let them dry out thoroughly after each workout.</p><h3>Will Wrist Wraps Make My Wrists Weak?</h3><p>Wrist wraps don't weaken your wrists: they enhance the strength that you already have, providing better stability and support to the wrist joints. Even while using the wraps, you still need to support the weight you lift and use force, using the musculature of your wrist joint. That means you won’t lose strength in your wrists.</p><h3>Should You Wear Wrist Wraps While Deadlifting?</h3><p>Wearing wrist wraps for deadlifts can improve your grip strength for maximum effort. Just wrap them tightly around the base of your palm to increase your performance. Grip issues are the key limiting factor for lifters' ability to increase weights while deadlifting. </p>",
