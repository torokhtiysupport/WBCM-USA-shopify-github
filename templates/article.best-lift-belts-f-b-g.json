The Pro is available in S-3XL (25”-55”) size range. It strikes a tricky compromise between comfort and core support. Some lifters feel 13mm belts jabbing into their ribs or hip bones as they bend to pick up the barbell. Going for thin leather or vinyl doesn’t assist with breaking PRs.</p><p>Therefore, 10mm solid leather cuts with 10cm of uniform width are ideal for doing power moves comfortably. A roller prong system continues this versatility. Ironbull has missed the trick of overriding the backside of steel buckles with leather, as exquisitely done by WBCM.

They are obviously not as tough as leather ones, so you won’t get enough back and abdominal support to max out compound lifts. On the other hand, nylon is comfortable and flexible: it's easier to move into, break into, and put it on and off thanks to a Velcro closure.</p><p>Rogue has also added a buckle and roller for seamless adjustments. The new USA belts showcase 6mm-thick foam panels with a shiny ripstop exterior that remains as good as new for years. These belts are 5” wide in the back, tapering down to 4” in front. The curve quickly contours to your body shape, staying out of the way of your dynamic movements.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h2>Do Bigger Guys Need a Weight Lifting Belt?</h2><p>A lifting belt supplements your natural ability to keep core muscles braced and spine neutral throughout the movement. That’s why lifters instantly add about 10%-15% to their PRs. Remember, a belt is an intermediate-to-advanced level tool to plunge across strength barriers and continue making gains.</p><p>When the time is right, everyone benefits from <a href=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/weight-lifting-belt-vs-back-brace/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/weight-lifting-belt-vs-back-brace/\">a lifting belt</a>. The right question to ask is not who needs it but when and why they need it.</p><p>You should consider wearing a belt once you’ve started lifting “heavy,” and it’s relative to the body weight. A rough baseline for compound exercises is around 1.5x of one’s body weight.</p><p>Accordingly, a 220-pound person must get past 300 lbs beltless, whereas a 130-pound elite female athlete can buckle up for a 200 lb lift. Whether you need a 25 inch or a 60 inch weight lifting belt is irrelevant.</p><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>Exercises that hugely benefit from belt usage are the ones that challenge your core or involve overhead movements. Conventional examples are back and front squats, deadlifts, rows, cleans-&-jerks, and military presses.</em></p><h2>What Are the Benefits of Wearing a Weight Lifting Belt?</h2><p>A weight lifting belt can bring a bunch of benefits to your training, regardless of your body size and frame. An observational study recounts the increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), spinal stability, and the reduction of back compressive forces and injury risks as <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Fulltext/2022/02180/The_influence_of_weightlifting_belts_and_wrist.57.aspx#:~:text=It%20is%20widely%20acknowledged%20that,spinal%20injuries%20during%20weightlifting%20training\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Fulltext/2022/02180/The_influence_of_weightlifting_belts_and_wrist.57.aspx#:~:text=It%20is%20widely%20acknowledged%20that,spinal%20injuries%20during%20weightlifting%20training\">widely acknowledged benefits of belt usage</a>.</p><p>Drawing upon it, we can expect a certain boost in the following two aspects:</p><h3>1. Performance</h3><p>Core muscles are critical in heavy barbell training, from spinal stabilization to force transfer. You have to take a deep breath and brace your abdominal cavities, a technique called the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222073/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23222073/\">Valsalva maneuver</a>. It stiffens your torso and dials up IAP. Wearing a belt creates a wall to push your belly against, helping control breaths and breaking records. Both the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17047531/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17047531/\">belt usage and inhaling generate IAP</a>. The exact increase may vary with each individual, exercise, and belt type.</p><p>One study pitched <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1533266/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1533266/\">beltless vs. belted squats over multiple reps</a>. A continuous 25%-40% boost in IAP was recorded with the switch. Furthermore, the activity of the involved core and paraspinal muscles remained unchanged. Another research concluded that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11710410/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11710410/\">belt usage accelerates barbell velocity and movement speed</a> during squats without alerting the joint range of motion. While deadlifting, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35363215/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35363215/\">total time and perceived exertion</a> decrease by using a belt.  </p>",

If IAP fails to rise sufficiently, the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140138108559233\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140138108559233\">lower back is at a greater risk of injury</a>. A belt maintains trunk tension while preventing hyperextension of the back. That’s why you should erect thicker walls for heavier spinal loading. <a href=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/nylon-vs-leather-lifting-belt/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/guides/nylon-vs-leather-lifting-belt/\">Nylon belts</a> are great for recreational, beginner-level exercises, but they tend to flex and give in.</p><p>There is also the case of weight-induced back pain due to lifting. If you’re a big, tall, bulky guy – think more about it. Weight lifting <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1479027/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1479027/\">belts can take away some of that spinal stress and shrinkage</a>. Note that lifting belts are a preventive, not a corrective, measure against weight-induced back pain, injuries, and fractures.</p><p><strong>The literature review hints that a possible facet of mental strength and confidence is involved as well. Most studies present participants’ opinions about feeling less discomfort and an inherent boost in willpower and self-belief. A 1996 pioneering study concluded that back belts give users a </strong><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15677061/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15677061/\"><strong>subjective impression of increased support and lifting capacity</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Overall, using a weight lifting belt will strengthen your breathing and bracing patterns, improving overall lifting performance and safety. The technique, muscle engagement, and range of motion don’t seem to deteriorate.</p><p>Along with physical benefits, mental toughness is sharpened to tackle challenges. You should only strap up for max-effort attempts (over 80% of 1RM) in order to realize actual gains. Otherwise, it may end up turning into a crutch.</p><h2>What Should Bigger Guys Look for When Buying a Weight Lifting Belt?</h2><p>When you don’t fall in that average category, purchasing anything demands a bit of extra attention. The following is the set of specifications and features for big and tall weight lifting belts.</p><h3>1. Materials</h3><p>The material choice ultimately determines the support, flexibility, and durability of the belt.</p><p>A top-grade leather belt provides massive support and a lifelong company. It’s your best bet if you’re planning to smash compounded exercises regularly with tons of weights. It can be rigid, restrictive, and take some time to break in. Nylon is an alternative choice, a tough synthetic fabric that promises a mix of support and flexibility. It doesn't aid with heavy lifting as much as its leather-made counterparts.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h3>2. Sizing and Fit</h3><p>Once you’ve measured yourself up (can’t use the pant size), see the size chart of your shortlisted products. Make sure whether they’re regular fit or need sizing up/down. Mostly, you'll be looking at plus-sized variants like these:</p><ul><li><strong>XL weight lifting belts:</strong> 35”-40”/90-114 cm waist</li><li><strong>XXL weight lifting belts:</strong> 38”-48”/97-121 cm waist</li><li><strong>XXXL weight lifting belts:</strong> 41”-52”/105-131 cm waist</li></ul><p>The sample is taken from WBCM belts and may vary with each manufacturer and model. Use your primary fitness goal (bulking or losing weight) to guide this decision. Don’t hesitate to contact the seller in case you have any doubts.</p><h3>3. Dimensions of the Belt</h3><p>The width is most likely not an issue for big and bulky guys. A minimum of 4” back coverage will do fantastic. If you’re preparing for a competition, always check out dimension-related rules mandated by the relevant governing federations.</p><p>Figuring out optimal thickness is a rather puzzling matter. Chunky belts are highly supportive but less flexible. Since a heavy person uses a belt for pulling serious weight, choosing high-quality thick leather ensures sufficient support and stabilization.</p><p>However, if you’re solely interested in powerlifting, go for a 13mm hardy, while 6-10mm belts will round up dynamic weightlifting and cross-training movements as well.

Not that powerlifters are inflexible — they simply don’t need that much flexibility to execute squats, deadlifts, and benches.

It determines two key factors: security and adjustability. A reliable lockdown stays done up even under great stress, maintaining abdominal pressure and support. The adjustability refers to how quickly and smoothly you can switch the belt’s tightness. Athletes may have to adjust the fit for each session based on the exercise and bloating.</p><h4>Velcro Closure Type</h4><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> Low</li><li><strong>Adjustability:</strong> High</li></ul><h4>Single Prong Closure Type</h4><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> Medium</li><li><strong>Adjustability:</strong> Medium</li></ul><h4>Lever Closure Type</h4><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> High</li><li><strong>Adjustability:</strong> Low</li></ul><p>As you can see, security and adjustability are in an inverse relationship. Velcro tabs are the most adjustable but least secure closure type, while a lever buckle offers maximum security but low adjustability. However, keep in mind that with a lever buckle you’ll need a screwdriver to change its position. Prong buckles, on the other hand, is a win-win option that provides decent security and adjustability.</p><h2>How to Properly Wear a Lifting Belt When You’re a Bigger Guy?</h2><p>If you’re moving before a mirror like a contortionist with your brand-new plus size weight lifting belt in hand, you’re not alone. Figuring out the proper use may be trickier than your little shopping errand, although you’d gradually get the hang of it. Follow these tips to smash your first belted round:</p><h3>1. Placement</h3><p>Find an ideal spot to clamp the belt. The navel usually serves as a pointer. However, you may like it better a little higher, especially if you’re packing a large belly.</p><p>The bottom line is to secure the belt in place, providing consistent core and lower back support.</p>",
