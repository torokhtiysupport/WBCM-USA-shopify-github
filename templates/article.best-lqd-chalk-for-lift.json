First is the alcohol-free version. If you have sensitive skin prone to tears, cuts, and calluses, you’ll immediately reach for this one. The burning sensation is completely gone, and the layer of chalk is quite thick, providing an additional protective barrier. That said, it does take around 60-90 seconds to dry down.</p><p>The second choice is the newly formulated 80% alcohol hygienic formula. We’ll talk more about the use of alcohol-based chalk as a hand sanitizer, but just know that it’s highly effective at killing germs and bacteria. This makes it a great choice for use in public gyms, especially if you’re traveling and concerned about hygiene.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the original formula based on alcohol, but there’s no particular reason to recommend it over the other two. All three options come in one 75ml (~2.5oz) size only. The packaging is great though, with a flexible plastic tube and thick cap.

Previously, the ingredients section included honey as an adhesive. Its removal could explain why the newer version appears to be watered down, although it is easier to wash out.</p><p>The price is fairly low considering the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CL94PTH?tag=wbcmb-20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CL94PTH?tag=wbcmb-20\">big bottle</a> size.

It’s used in rock climbing, gymnastics, aerial arts (hoops, pole dancing), calisthenics, and weightlifting, to name a few.</p><p>Despite sharing the name, it’s not to be confused with regular drawing/classroom chalk, as they’re made from completely different materials. Workout chalk is made out of <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Magnesium-Carbonate\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Magnesium-Carbonate\">Magnesium Carbonate</a> (MgCO3), which is primarily known for and used in chemistry for its absorbent and drying properties.</p><p>Originally, hand chalk came as either a powdered substance or as a block. More recently, liquid chalk has taken the stage, figuratively and literally, because it has some unique advantages (more on this in a later segment). It comes in plastic bottles, making it much easier to store and carry than powder chalk.</p><h2>How Does Liquid Chalk Work?</h2><p>Liquid hand chalk is made from the same Magnesium Carbonate mixed with a liquid adhesive, usually alcohol. When squeezed out of the bottle, it feels fluid like a cream, making it easy to spread evenly on your palms. Once it dries down, it leaves behind the moisture-wicking MgCO3 layer.</p><p>In sports, MgCO3 is rubbed into the palms to absorb sweat and keep the skin dry, preventing slipping when gripping onto a surface. It’s especially useful when gripping cylindrical objects, such as barbells or handlebars, to minimize friction from rolling.</p><p>The idea behind Magnesium Carbonate is grounded in known chemistry, and there’s plenty of research into its effects in various sports. For example, chalk has been shown to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11411778/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20chalk%20decreased%20the%20coefficient%20of%20friction.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11411778/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20chalk%20decreased%20the%20coefficient%20of%20friction.\">decrease friction</a> during rock climbing.</p><p>Calisthenics athletes do plenty of exercises by gripping onto handlebars (pull-ups, drips, monkey bars), and using chalk has also been shown to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29541333/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29541333/\">improve grip duration</a>.

However, people have different needs and preferences, such as brand, stickiness, price, as well as their sport of choice, which may sway purchasing decisions. With that in mind, here are some aspects to consider when choosing the best gym chalk:</p><p>1. Grip Effectiveness</p><p>The stickiness of your chalk depends on the ratio between Magnesium Carbonate and the carrier fluid. Higher MgCO3 content will result in stickier chalk, providing a more robust grip, while chalk with a higher percentage of liquid is easier to wash out. Depending on the difficulty of your exercise, you might value grip effectiveness differently.</p><h3>2. Dry Time</h3><p>Most liquid chalk dries fairly quickly, between 10-20 seconds depending on your skin texture and room humidity. For most people, a few seconds difference won’t be too much of a factor, but it may be for those who need their chalk to dry quicker. For example, during competitive endeavors where time is essential like rock climbing races or cross-training competitions.</p>",

Smell</h3><p>Some liquid chalk brands are odorless, while some might have a mild fragrance. As your hands warm up from the exercise, the chalk will heat up and release the smell. It’s a good idea to check the smell before purchase, as it might be a scent you’re not fond of or the one that your brain associates with allergies you may have, making it distracting to use.</p>",

For us, we can vouch safely for our picks when it comes to weightlifting and strength training. However, if you practice other things that also use chalk, such as rock climbing or outdoor calisthenics, you should look for trusted reviews for your specific sport or discipline.</p><h3>6. Value for Money</h3><p>Although more expensive than powdered chalk on average, generally speaking, liquid chalk won’t be a budget-breaking purchase. Price differences between brands are not more than a few dollars. That said, shopping around isn’t a bad idea either. Depending on your needs and frequency of use, you might find a certain brand’s bottle size, shelf life, ease and cost of shipment, etc. more attractive.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Application of Liquid Chalk</h2><p>Applying liquid hand chalk may seem straightforward, but there’s a proper way of doing it. Here’s a step-by-step checklist:</p><h3>1. How to Apply Liquid Chalk?</h3><ol><li>Wash your hands then dry them down with your gym towel.</li><li>Shake the bottle to even out the contents.</li><li>Unseal the cap and squeeze out a small pebble-sized amount.</li><li>Before you start spreading, close the cap to seal off the air and avoid accidental spillage.</li><li>Spread evenly across your hands, making sure to rub in between the fingers as well.</li><li>Let it dry for however long the package or user manual says.</li><li>Give it a test run and see how it feels to grip. Apply some more if you’re unhappy with the stick, otherwise, you’re all set.</li></ol><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"Most people do one big squeeze and then spread it over their hands.</em></p><p><em>As a result, they often end up with more chalk on one hand than the other. Instead, do two smaller squeezes per hand — it spreads more evenly that way.\"</em></p><h3>2. How to Remove Liquid Chalk?</h3><ol><li>Wash your hands with water, the chalk residue will start to dissolve fairly easily.</li><li>Use liquid soap to get a deeper clean.</li><li>Check and scrub your knuckles and fingerprints.</li><li>Rinse and towel dry.</li></ol>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h2>The Main Mistakes When Using Liquid Chalk for Lifting</h2><p>Now that you know how to apply liquid chalk for weightlifting, here are some basic mistakes to avoid:</p><h3>1. Applying to Wet Hands</h3><p>Make sure your skin is dry before applying liquid chalk. If your palms are wet from sweat or water, the chalk will not dry down as well or efficiently. This can have the opposite effect of actually making your grip more slippery.</p><h3>2. Applying Too Much Chalk</h3><p>Similar to applying on wet hands, applying too much chalk can stop it from drying down and applying the desired effect. It can also leave behind messy palm prints. You only need a smidgen per hand relative to your palm size. It’s easier to add more in case of need than to wash out and try again.</p><h3>3. Using When Unnecessary</h3><p>Chalk assists us when things get intense, and a firm grip can make or break the exercise. However, using it when unnecessary, such as on weight increments or rep and set numbers that aren’t challenging our grip, is a waste.</p><p>Firstly, it’s always a good idea to let the hands naturally develop grip strength, as it not only makes our grip better in exercises but also improves our quality of life. Secondly, gripping with exposed skin will toughen it over time. Additionally, relying on external aids can cause psychological dependence.</p><p>As a side note, using it more frequently makes you go through bottles quicker, so you end up spending more money in the long run.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h3>4. Ignoring Expiration Dates</h3><p>Alcohol-based liquid weightlifting chalk has an expiration date. Over time, the alcohol content will dissolve and evaporate from air exposure, breaking down the fluidity of the chalk, which can make it harder to apply and reduce its effectiveness.</p><h2>Powder Chalk vs. Liquid Chalk Key Differences</h2><p>The choice between liquid chalk vs. regular chalk, which comes in bricks or powder bags, will mostly come down to preference, but some factors may sway your decision.</p><p>Both options are easy to apply. Powder chalk is immediately ready, while liquid chalk requires 10-20 seconds to dry. However, powder chalk is good for one or two, maybe three uses depending on friction, whereas liquid chalk can last an entire set or workout, saving time in the long run.</p><p>Storage and portability also favor liquid chalk. A block of powder needs something like a plastic container for transport, which is more effort than a simple carry bottle. In addition, there’s the risk of a powder chalk container opening and spreading in your gym bag, on the floor, etc. Powder chalk also becomes harder to apply as it's ground down, while the brick becomes smaller, unlike tubed chalk that maintains easy application.</p><p>Regular chalk is messy if not carefully applied, spreading debris and powder easily as you rub it into your hands, and leaving hand imprints on any surface you touch (wall, clothing, rack, etc.). Removing it from barbells, especially between knurling, can also be annoying. Liquid chalk helps avoid a powdered mess and is easier to wash out.</p><p>Public gyms typically don’t allow chalk due to messiness. That said, some gyms strictly prohibit powder chalk but allow liquid chalk in lifting areas, for example. Both are generally allowed for competitive use, but if you bring your own, you’ll have to submit it for inspection.</p>",

            "rich_text_content": "<p>Price is one of the few factors where powder chalk wins out convincingly as it is much cheaper. Additionally, since it doesn’t use alcohol or other adhesives, there’s essentially no expiry date. It’s an okay choice if you use it very sporadically, such as a few times per year.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Does Liquid Chalk Cause Dry Hands?</h3><p>Gym chalk prevents the palms from sweating by absorbing it underneath the layer of chalk. However, this does mean you interfere with natural perspiration. While normal doses of liquid chalk for gym use won’t cause skin problems, applying it too often and leaving it on too long can leave the skin dry. It’s important to wash out the chalk and moisturize your hands to prevent dry hands.</p><h3>Can You Use Normal Chalk For Lifting?</h3><p>No, everyday chalk, such as blackboard chalk, is not the same as hand chalk for gym use. Despite the name, it’s not made from the same material. Regular chalk is based on calcium sulfate. When you rub it against a blackboard, for example, it grinds down to leave behind a trace.</p><p>Skin is not a hard enough surface to do this against. Even if you managed to grind it down separately and spread it on your hands, it doesn’t have the same skin-drying properties as magnesium-carbonate-based workout chalk, meaning it won’t improve your grip.</p><h3>How Long Does 50ml Liquid Chalk Last?</h3><p>A bottle of 50ml liquid weightlifting chalk lasts for about 50 uses. However, it depends on factors like your palm size and how much you prefer to use. If you have sensitive skin, you might find that a thicker layer of chalk helps, so you’ll naturally use more per squeeze. </p><h3>Does Liquid Chalk Prevent Calluses?</h3><p>Liquid hand chalk can add a protective layer to the skin to prevent some abrasion and friction. This might help against the formation of calluses but isn’t a solution against them. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/calluses-on-hands#causes:~:text=All%20calluses%20are%20caused%20by%20repetitive%20movements%20that%20produce%20friction%20on%20your%20skin.%20Over%20time%2C%20the%20dead%20skin%20cells%20build%20up%20and%20harden%20over%20your%20new%20ones%20as%20a%20defense%20mechanism%20to%20protect%20the%20skin%20underneath%20the%20callus.\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/calluses-on-hands#causes:~:text=All%20calluses%20are%20caused%20by%20repetitive%20movements%20that%20produce%20friction%20on%20your%20skin.%20Over%20time%2C%20the%20dead%20skin%20cells%20build%20up%20and%20harden%20over%20your%20new%20ones%20as%20a%20defense%20mechanism%20to%20protect%20the%20skin%20underneath%20the%20callus.\">Calluses form</a> as a result of repeated friction and pressure against the skin.</p><p>If you’re gripping something heavy that requires a lot of grip pressure to not let go of (for example, a heavy barbell) the thin layer of chalk will not do much for you. You’ll need a thicker layer of protection, for example, weightlifting gloves.</p><h3>Do Commercial Gyms Allow Liquid Chalk?</h3><p>Most commercial gyms don’t allow the use of workout chalk because it’s messy. Some gyms make an exception for liquid chalk because it doesn’t leave behind powder, but you’ll have to inquire at the gym or check out their terms and conditions.</p><p>Gyms and training centers specifically oriented to weightlifting/powerlifting often do allow chalk. Otherwise, investing in a pair of weightlifting gloves is a good idea.</p><h2>Can You Use Liquid Chalk In Powerlifting & Weightlifting Competitions?</h2><p>The use of liquid chalk for powerlifting & weightlifting competitions is allowed. For example, the <a href=\"https://iwf.sport/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2023/07/IWF-TCRR-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://iwf.sport/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2023/07/IWF-TCRR-2023.pdf\">International Weightlifting Federation (Summer Olympic Games) official rulebook</a> allows it. So does the <a href=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.powerlifting.sport/fileadmin/ipf/data/rules/technical-rules/english/IPF_Technical_Rules_Book_2024.pdf\">International Powerlifting Federation rulebook</a> (under magnesium carbonate).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.usapowerlifting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/USAPL-Rulebook-v2023.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.usapowerlifting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/USAPL-Rulebook-v2023.1.pdf\">The USA Powerlifting rulebook</a> even specifies liquid chalk in section 3.16.7.1., as long as it doesn’t have adhesive additives. Keep in mind that if you want to bring your own (liquid or powder) chalk, you’ll have to provide it for inspection by the committee.</p>",
