It’s used in rock climbing, gymnastics, aerial arts (hoops, pole dancing), calisthenics, and weightlifting, to name a few.</p><p>Despite sharing the name, it’s not to be confused with regular drawing/classroom chalk, as they’re made from completely different materials. Workout chalk is made out of Magnesium Carbonate (MgCO3), which is primarily known for and used in chemistry for its absorbent and drying properties.</p><p>Originally, hand chalk came as either a powdered substance or as a block. More recently, liquid chalk has taken the stage, figuratively and literally, because it has some unique advantages (more on this in a later segment). It comes in plastic bottles, making it much easier to store and carry than powder chalk.</p><h2>How Does Liquid Chalk Work?</h2><p>Liquid hand chalk is made from the same Magnesium Carbonate mixed with a liquid adhesive, usually alcohol. When squeezed out of the bottle, it feels fluid like a cream, making it easy to spread evenly on your palms. Once it dries down, it leaves behind the moisture-wicking MgCO3 layer.</p><p>In sports, MgCO3 is rubbed into the palms to absorb sweat and keep the skin dry, preventing slipping when gripping onto a surface. It’s especially useful when gripping cylindrical objects, such as barbells or handlebars, to minimize friction from rolling.</p><p>The idea behind Magnesium Carbonate is grounded in known chemistry, and there’s plenty of research into its effects in various sports. For example, chalk has been shown to decrease friction during rock climbing.</p><p>Calisthenics athletes do plenty of exercises by gripping onto handlebars (pull-ups, drips, monkey bars), and using chalk has also been shown to improve grip duration. Similar results were found in a study observing chalk’s use in weightlifting.</p>",

Thus, it’s a good idea to use it, especially with public equipment.</p><p>The only slight drawback might be the burning sensation when you rub alcohol into palms with micro-cuts and ripped calluses, for example, which isn’t uncommon. Otherwise, there are non-alcohol versions.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Using Liquid Chalk for Lifting</h2><p>So far, we’ve established what liquid weightlifting chalk is and how it benefits you. However, liquid chalk is not all upsides no downsides.

However, people have different needs and preferences, such as brand, stickiness, price, as well as their sport of choice, which may sway purchasing decisions. With that in mind, here are some aspects to consider when choosing the best gym chalk:</p><p>1. Grip Effectiveness</p><p>The stickiness of your chalk depends on the ratio between Magnesium Carbonate and the carrier fluid. Higher MgCO3 content will result in stickier chalk, providing a more robust grip, while chalk with a higher percentage of liquid is easier to wash out. Depending on the difficulty of your exercise, you might value grip effectiveness differently.</p><h3>2. Dry Time</h3><p>Most liquid chalk dries fairly quickly, between 10-20 seconds depending on your skin texture and room humidity. For most people, a few seconds difference won’t be too much of a factor, but it may be for those who need their chalk to dry quicker. For example, during competitive endeavors where time is essential like rock climbing races or cross-training competitions.</p>",

A smooth and even-textured liquid with tiny grains of chalk is easier to apply and spreads out more evenly. It’s also easier to wash out afterward. </p><h3>4. Smell</h3><p>Some liquid chalk brands are odorless, while some might have a mild fragrance. As your hands warm up from the exercise, the chalk will heat up and release the smell. It’s a good idea to check the smell before purchase, as it might be a scent you’re not fond of or the one that your brain associates with allergies you may have, making it distracting to use.</p>",

For us, we can vouch safely for our picks when it comes to weightlifting and strength training. However, if you practice other things that also use chalk, such as rock climbing or outdoor calisthenics, you should look for trusted reviews for your specific sport or discipline.</p><h3>6. Value for Money</h3><p>Although more expensive than powdered chalk on average, generally speaking, liquid chalk won’t be a budget-breaking purchase. Price differences between brands are not more than a few dollars. That said, shopping around isn’t a bad idea either. Depending on your needs and frequency of use, you might find a certain brand’s bottle size, shelf life, ease and cost of shipment, etc. more attractive.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Application of Liquid Chalk</h2><p>Applying liquid hand chalk may seem straightforward, but there’s a proper way of doing it. Here’s a step-by-step checklist:</p><h3>1. How to Apply Liquid Chalk?</h3><ol><li>Wash your hands then dry them down with your gym towel.</li><li>Shake the bottle to even out the contents.</li><li>Unseal the cap and squeeze out a small pebble-sized amount.</li><li>Before you start spreading, close the cap to seal off the air and avoid accidental spillage.</li><li>Spread evenly across your hands, making sure to rub in between the fingers as well.</li><li>Let it dry for however long the package or user manual says.</li><li>Give it a test run and see how it feels to grip. Apply some more if you’re unhappy with the stick, otherwise, you’re all set.</li></ol><h3>Pro Tip:</h3><p><em>\"Most people do one big squeeze and then spread it over their hands.</em></p><p><em>As a result, they often end up with more chalk on one hand than the other. Instead, do two smaller squeezes per hand — it spreads more evenly that way.\"</em></p><h3>2. How to Remove Liquid Chalk?</h3><ol><li>Wash your hands with water, the chalk residue will start to dissolve fairly easily.</li><li>Use liquid soap to get a deeper clean.</li><li>Check and scrub your knuckles and fingerprints.</li><li>Rinse and towel dry.</li></ol>",

            "rich_text_content": "<h2>The Main Mistakes When Using Liquid Chalk for Lifting</h2><p>Now that you know how to apply liquid chalk for weightlifting, here are some basic mistakes to avoid:</p><h3>1. Applying to Wet Hands</h3><p>Make sure your skin is dry before applying liquid chalk. If your palms are wet from sweat or water, the chalk will not dry down as well or efficiently. This can have the opposite effect of actually making your grip more slippery.</p><h3>2. Applying Too Much Chalk</h3><p>Similar to applying on wet hands, applying too much chalk can stop it from drying down and applying the desired effect. It can also leave behind messy palm prints. You only need a smidgen per hand relative to your palm size. It’s easier to add more in case of need than to wash out and try again.</p><h3>3. Using When Unnecessary</h3><p>Chalk assists us when things get intense, and a firm grip can make or break the exercise. However, using it when unnecessary, such as on weight increments or rep and set numbers that aren’t challenging our grip, is a waste.</p><p>Firstly, it’s always a good idea to let the hands naturally develop grip strength, as it not only makes our grip better in exercises but also improves our quality of life. Secondly, gripping with exposed skin will toughen it over time. Additionally, relying on external aids can cause psychological dependence.</p><p>As a side note, using it more frequently makes you go through bottles quicker, so you end up spending more money in the long run.</p>",
