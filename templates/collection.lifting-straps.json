They also vouch for safety during free weight exercises and improve the lifter's grip strength.<\/p><p>Usually, lifting straps are made of cotton, nylon, leather, or other sturdy and flexible material that wraps around the wrist and the handle of the used equipment. As a result, weightlifters will be able to lift more weights with less effort and reduced risk of injury. <\/p><p>The mechanical advantage of your wrist is directly related to the amount of force you can lift. This is the reason why you can lift more weight when you're just starting weightlifting. It's vital to be careful and not overload the wrists when performing exercises that involve repetitions or movements that strain the wrists. <\/p><p>Overall, it's a universal training accessory that can be used both by beginners and advanced lifters, providing better grip control when doing heavy reps. However, it is important to choose the best type of weightlifting straps considering your fitness level and training goals.<\/p>",

More Qualitative and Harder Strength Training Sessions<\/h3><p>As lifting straps support your wrists, you can lift heavier weights with them. That's why bodybuilders and Olympic weightlifters prefer using lifting straps — to push their limits and achieve their personal best.<\/p><h3>4. Proper Muscle Fatigue<\/h3><p>Bodybuilding and weightlifting sports require total muscle fatigue to work out the muscles to their full exhaustion. With gym straps, an athlete will be able to prolong their intense workout to reach true muscle fatigue. You’ll be able to hit the largest muscle groups with an appropriate stimulus for their growth and strength gain.<\/p><h3>5. Protection from Calluses<\/h3><p>Lifters often face the problem of calluses’ occurrence from repeated gripping of barbells or dumbbells with aggressive knurling. If you tear a callus, you need some time for your hand to heal which can stop your regular training regime as it will be difficult and painful to grip anything without irritating the skin. Lifting straps can protect your palms from building calluses since your skin isn't in direct contact with the metal.<\/p><p>It's recommended to wear gym wrist straps when performing lifting exercises with a loaded barbell with an aggressive knurl pattern.<\/p>",

            "text": "<h3>1. Deadlifts:<\/h3><p>Holding a weighted barbell, you should fold at the hips and lower the bar down to the floor with your back straight. Using the power of legs, you should lift the bar back up, pushing your hips forward against the bar. Barbell straps will take the strain out of your wrists, allowing you to focus more on the technique. You can use closed-loop or figure-eight straps for this exercise.<\/p><h3>2. Dumbbell or barbell rows:<\/h3><p>Holding any lifting accessory in a bent-over position, move your elbows back, pulling the weight up to your sides, then return to the initial position. With proper wrist support, you can focus on your arms and upper back. It will be okay if you’ll use lasso straps for any type of rows, i.e., barbell or one-arm rows.<\/p><h3>3. Snatches:<\/h3><p>Holding a kettlebell or dumbbell in one hand, swing the weight in front of you till the above-head position, then swing the weight back down. Lifting straps will help to stabilize your wrist while swinging weights. Closed-loop straps will be good for this exercise, as well as for other Olympic lifts.<\/p><h3>4. Lat pulldowns:<\/h3><p>Working out on the lat pulldown machine, you grip the bar with an overhand grip and pull it down to the top of your chest, and return it to the starting position. With lifting grips, you'll be able to stabilize your wrist in the pull-down movement. Lasso straps will come in handy for such exercises thanks to its versatility and easiness of use, as well as applicability to common exercises.<\/p><h3>5. Pull-ups and chin-ups:<\/h3><p>While pulling yourself up on the horizontal bar until your hands are level with your shoulders, and lowering yourself back to the starting position, you get extra support for your wrists as you hang from the bar. Lasso lifting straps will fit these movements due to their sufficient length.<\/p>",

            "text": "<h3>Choose the Proper Type of Lifting Straps<\/h3><p>Lasso straps are the most popular since they’re versatile and are best for exercises that involve back muscles. However, if you plan to perform clean and jerk-type exercises, lasso straps are not perfect for that because you won’t be able to release the bar quickly.<\/p><p>Single-loop straps are good for Olympic weightlifting since they offer minimal support and you’ll be able to release the bar instantly. The same features refer to the closed loop straps: they’re also a top choice for Oly weightlifters, but won’t work during deadlifts and rows.<\/p><p>Figure 8 straps are a thicker option with two large loops to secure the bar to your wrist. They fit most strength-oriented training and heavy pulling exercises like deadlifts.<\/p><h3>Select the Proper Material<\/h3><p>Cotton straps feel the most comfortable for your skin as they have sweat-absorbent features. Nylon straps aren’t as good at moisture-absorbing as cotton, although they’ll work well for Olympic lifts due to their durability and an athlete can quickly release the bar. Leather straps are the most stable and are the easiest to roll into place. However, you need some time to make them break in and can feel harsh on the skin compared to the cotton and nylon ones.<\/p><h3>Mind the Material Quality<\/h3><p>To be sure of the overall quality of the lifting straps, check their stitching and whether the material is stretchy enough. In addition, consider features like padding and texture feel, which will improve grip and friction, so you won’t lose the bar occasionally. Some padding can add cushioning to avoid pain in wrists and forearms.<\/p>",
